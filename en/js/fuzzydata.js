"body" : "The scheduling mode (also called task type) is a mathematical formula used by the OnePlan work plan to automate scheduling as you build and adjust your work plan. The scheduling mode calculation uses three task values: Duration : How long the task will take. Measured in days by default. Effort : How many total hours are estimated to do the task. Default effort is 8 hours Effort = 1 day Duration. Units : The percent a resource is allocated to a task. Default 100% allocation of one resource = 8 hours Effort, or 1 day Duration. Duration, Effort, and Units are all based on the calendar applied to a given task. The default calendar is set to 1 day = 8 hours = 100% allocation for 1 day, with a 40 hour work week. However, you can apply custom calendars which can change these values, and thus change the Duration, Effort, and Units calculations in the work planner. The scheduling mode defines which task properties are fixed (provided by user) and which ones should be calculated. You may set the scheduling mode at the plan level, which will set the default for each new task in your plan, or change individual tasks as needed. There is also an Effort Driven setting that fixes the task effort value. When set, it tells the event to preserve its effort value and recalculate the other properties. At the plan level, scheduling mode is referred to as the Task Type . See How do I add the Default Task Type field? to add the Default Task Type field to your OnePlan group. When you set the scheduling mode \/ task type at the plan level, all new tasks added to the plan will automatically be set to the selected scheduling mode \/ task type.

"body" : "Here we see Cost Types. Cost types allow organizations to calculate, evaluate and monitor how resources are being allocated. There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some example use cases that may apply. The Committed Hours cost type would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. The Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type.

"body" : "This article explains how the Resource Manager pre-filter works for users set as resource managers in OnePlan admin. Resource managers are off by default. To set up resource managers, see How do I set Resource Managers?. The resource manager pre-filter is a server-side filter that loads resources into the Resource Plan area and\/or Resource Center area based on user permissions and Resource Managers admin settings. Owners and Managers Users with Owner or Manager permissions can view all resources in their OnePlan group, and can use the pre-filter to narrow down the list of resources in the Resource Plan area. The pre-filter is based on the Method set in the Resource Managers settings. For example, Owners or Managers who are set as resource managers using a Business Unit method, the users will see a Business Unit filter in the Resource Plan area. Contributors Users with Contributor permissions do not have access to other resources in their group. However, as a resource manager, Contributors can see the resources they manage in the Resource Plan area and Resource Center area. For example, if a Contributor is designated as a resource manager for IT, they will be able to view all of the IT resources in the Resource Plan area and Resource Center area. But, they cannot view any other resources. " },

There are possible (and often likely) differences between how our resources’ time is initially planned, booked onto specific work, and then actually spent. The Resource Plan allows multiple cost types so you may analyze the differences. You can toggle from one cost type to another. The reason these groupings are called “cost” types is because the resource plan hours may be converted to costs when they are imported into the financial plan. The rate for each resource, according to their role or other cost category factor would be multiplied by the number of hours to get the financial value of that resource’s time. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. See Cost Type Settings to configure custom cost types. Here are some example use cases that may apply. Committed Hours would be the initial plan generally estimated at a high level. This is also referred to as top-down planning. Scheduled Hours cost type would be the totals from the detailed task schedule. You could import the task schedule hours into this resource plan cost type. Actual Hours cost type would be the time spent on this plan. You could import the timesheet hours into this resource plan cost type.

You can toggle from one cost type to another. A cost type may be editable or not. If not, the data is likely being imported from another financial system for reference. Your organization may have similar or different cost types depending on business use cases and configuration. Here are some common general uses that may apply. A Budget is the initial plan for what is estimated to be spent on this initiative. Expected costs are entered into cost categories. A cost category is how costs or gains are broken out into smaller defined categories. These are often organized as whether they are labor costs, and also whether they fall into expense type buckets, such as capital or operational expenses. Once the Budget gets approved and a plan moves forward in the process, The Forecast costs are often used as the ongoing expected or estimated costs, updated as the plan or initiative continues. The forecast costs can be entered manually, or copied from another cost type, such as Budget. Then, updated as needed. The Actuals cost type shows what has already been spent on the plan. Another common example of a cost type is Benefits. This is where you would track what is expected to be gained from this plan. Notice the cost categories would be different in terms of what is gained vs another cost type for financials spent. " },

Users can also view & work with the tasks in a KanBan board. You must have both Microsoft Project Desktop and the OnePlan for Project Connector installed locally on your machine to use the OnePlan for Project Connector.
